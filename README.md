# Blender-AR-Camera-Tracker
An addon for Blender which enables the user to control the viewport camera with their mobile phone. An application which is installed on the phone tracks the nearby surfaces and calculates the postion and rotation of the phone. This information is later sent to Blender TCP server which moves the viewport camera accordingly.
